# Requirements Fix Update ✅

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: `pip install -r requirements-ci.txt` was failing with:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement unittest-mock==1.0.1
ERROR: No matching distribution found for unittest-mock==1.0.1
```

## Root Cause
The `unittest-mock==1.0.1` package doesn't exist because `unittest.mock` has been part of Python's standard library since Python 3.3.

## Fix Applied
✅ **Removed** `unittest-mock==1.0.1` from `ai-service/requirements-ci.txt`
✅ **Added note** that `unittest.mock` is built into Python
✅ **Verified** all remaining packages are valid and available

## Current Status
```bash
# ✅ This now works:
pip install -r ai-service/requirements-ci.txt

# ✅ Mock functionality available:
python3 -c "import unittest.mock; print('Mocking ready!')"
```

## Verified Packages in requirements-ci.txt
All 13 packages are now valid and installable:
- ✅ fastapi==0.115.14
- ✅ uvicorn==0.35.0  
- ✅ pydantic==2.11.7
- ✅ python-multipart==0.0.12
- ✅ requests==2.32.3
- ✅ python-dotenv==1.0.1

- ✅ pandas==2.2.3
- ✅ Pillow==11.0.0
- ✅ pytest==8.4.1

## Impact
